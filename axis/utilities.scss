// Mixin: Pie
// When turned on, enables css3 pie (http://css3pie.com/) for all
// elements that can use it. Which makes IE look a lot nicer.

@mixin pie() {
  behavior: url($pie-path) if $pie-enabled;
}

// Mixin: Rounded
//
// Unless you are working with a ridiculously large element, this will round the
// corners as much as css will allow. Even in IE.
//
// ex. rounded()

@mixin rounded() {
  border-radius: 999px;
  @include pie();
}
